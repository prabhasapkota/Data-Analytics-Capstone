# Goals of the Research:
The goal of this research is to leverage machine learning techniques on Global
Food and Agricultural Statistics datasets to uncover insights into fertilizer application, land management and aiming to optimize agricultural productivity while promoting sustainable resource use and minimizing environmental impact.This research will use Kaggle datasets about the Global Food and Agriculture Statistics. This dataset was kindly published by the United Nation on the UNData
site 

# Phases of the Research

# Getting Started
* Begin by creating a folder to house your information.
* This folder should contain all data that was found and will eventually be where you store the notebook.
* For organizational purposes, all data has been stored in the Data folder.
* After getting the data and performing cleaning operations, create a virtual environment within your repository.
* Type python -m venv .venv in your terminal to setup a virtual environment.
* To activate the virtual environment type .venv\Scripts\activate in the terminal.
* After creating the virtual environment use pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
* Once there, type jupyter lab in the terminal. If a browser does not automatically pop up, use CTRL + Click on the link provided.
